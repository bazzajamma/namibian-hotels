Placeholder Images
==================

This directory should contain placeholder images for development:

- placeholder-hotel.jpg - Hotel images
- placeholder-room.jpg - Room images  
- placeholder-restaurant.jpg - Restaurant images
- placeholder-offer.jpg - Offer images
- placeholder-destination.jpg - Destination images

You can use any images for development, or replace with actual images from Supabase Storage.
The application will work with mock data even without these images, but they will show broken image icons.

For production, images should be stored in Supabase Storage and referenced by URL in the database.
